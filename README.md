  'description': 'The mantra of chef Hideaki Sato is “pure, simple and seasonal”. His passion for cooking and his experimental approach on food combinations are evidenced by his original and extraordinary creations made with top-notch ingredients mostly from his native Japan. The tasting menu is highly season-driven; sourdough and cultured butter made daily in-house are simply addictive. The wine list features interesting Asian vintages as well as sake and adds to the memorable experience.',
