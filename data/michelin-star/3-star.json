    "description": "He may be one of the most famous chefs on the planet but Gordon Ramsay remains fiercely committed to maintaining the highest standards at his elegant yet relaxed flagship restaurant. Head chef and co-owner Matt Ab\u00e9 interprets the philosophy of Ramsay\u2019s style impeccably, meaning that dishes are exquisitely executed, with perfectly judged flavour contrasts and a lightness of touch. The menu features plenty of dishes, like lobster ravioli, which might be called \u2018classic Ramsay\u2019, but there are newer dishes too. Service is polished and professional but also has personality.",

Viki Geunes has stripped his restaurant of everything but the essentials.Sourcing outstanding quality ingredients is the key to success. The chef matches his acutely sensitive tastebuds with creative flair, pairing seabass, for example, with different textures of wild asparagus. Each mouthful fascinates, surprises, even disconcerts, provoking a felicitous chaos of flavour and texture. The powerful juices of seabass are mixed with the velvety taste of asparagus. The fastidiously meticulous chef deftly plays with each texture and flavour, crafting dishes that are complex and gutsy, yet free of fussy frills. In addition to knock-out sauces, exotic side dishes add a surprising, yet mild spicy note. Viki Geunes effortlessly demonstrates why he is regarded as one of the best chefs of his generation.",

His father was a cook in a traditional kaiseki restaurant (where special meals composed of a series of small courses are served \u2013 akin to Western haute cuisine), but it was while watching a documentary on French cuisine that his vocation truly became clear. Today, his work verges on perfection: a virtuoso of flavour combinations, always spot on when it comes to presentation on the plate, he gives pride of place to high-quality ingredients. For example, Wagyu beef from Kagoshima (the southernmost part of Kyushu Island) \u2013superbly marbled, with a plump, melt-in-the-mouth quality and a smoky and nutty taste, accompanied by beautiful pan-fried gnocchi.

Here, one thing is clear: it is the market and the harvest that dictate the menu. There is something for everyone: meat from the plateau, Le Puy green lentils, asparagus, broad beans, citrus fruits and, above all, mushrooms \u2013 the family's great speciality, which they pick in autumn in the dense undergrowth smothered by a thick carpet of leaves. A cuisine with strong roots, such as the farinade (pancake) with fresh herbs and woodruff stock, or the veal feuilleton with walnuts, red cabbage and cauliflower mushroom. Last but not least, the cheese platter with Salers, Fourme and Saint-Nectaire cheeses is irresistible!",

Now at the helm himself, he shows that he has been trained by the best in the business (Verg\u00e9, Gu\u00e9rard, Chapel). He cooks high-calibre cuisine \u2013 classic, generous and above all very tasty \u2013 and lets his Breton roots (on his mother's side) shine through. A larger-than-life presence on the restaurant floor, Lallement loves to engage with guests and certainly doesn't stand on ceremony. The dishes are accessible and enhanced by memorable sauces; ingredients are treated with loving care, as in the blue lobster dubbed \"a tribute to my dad\", and the farm-reared Onjon squab.

    "description": "This handsome abode in the upper reaches of Annecy is the haunt of chef Franck Derouet and his associate Thomas Lorival. Together they craft a culinary universe whose veggie and lake-focused slant is clearly motivated by a locavore philosophy and all the ingredients come from their own garden or within a 100km radius. Each dish is sprinkled with seasonal fruit, vegetables, flowers and herbs, adding a poetic, even an artistic flourish, illustrated by their creamy polenta with pike roe, fera (fish) with garden green curry or a wafer-thin chicory tart. In tune with this seasonal ethos, the chef works with meat, but very sparingly, (for example, during the coarse fish close season), depicted by a game jus drizzled over cardoons (heirloom vegetable). Similarly, the wines all come from local wineries. The duo of chefs is committed to exploring new culinary universes, for example, they offer a \u201cfood and jus\u201d pairing of vegetable stocks, broths and herbal teas with the different courses, in addition to wine-food pairings. Their complementary characters and complicity are as apparent in the kitchen as in the dining room, creating a banquet for the senses.",

    "description": "Alexandre Couillon rises at dawn to go to Noirmoutier fish auction, which sells the best Atlantic fish, before stopping by his own vegetable garden, just a few minutes from the restaurant. The tasting menu, which religiously keeps pace with the seasons and availability, exalts and celebrates fine ingredients, allowing them to shout their name with a simplicity that only the world\u2019s top chefs can attain. Knowing what and where to strip back and pare down to release the flavours and tantalise the eater\u2019s imagination is a fine art. The quality of the fish, seafood and vegetables is exceptional. Alexandre\u2019s other talents include cooking over a fire, harvesting coastal plants, fruit coulis and vegetable pickles, broth and gutsy jus, without forgetting cooking fish to absolute perfection! Memories shine bright of both the mackerel cooked over hot embers and accompanied by confit beetroot or an incredible lettuce grilled over a flame, blueberries in elderflower vinegar and the dessert of buckwheat, caramel mousse, confit citrus fruits and sea lettuce (seaweed) sorbet. The interior has been revamped in natural materials and soft colours, while the grocery shop, Le Petit Couillon, sells produce from the artisans and farmer partners.",

Nestled in the Anse de Corton, a natural, unspoilt cove opposite Cap Canaille, it boasts a dream location above the blue waves of the Mediterranean. Hailing from Normandy, chef Dimitri Droisneau has a CV to be reckoned with (La Tour d'Argent, Lucas Carton, Ambroisie); he fell in love with Provence, which for him is a constant source of inspiration. From one dish to another, it makes its presence felt \u2013 light, subtle, tasty, fresh and aromatic, punchy when necessary, and always surprising and original. All the magic of the South of France \u2013 produce from land and sea, its fish and herbs, wild and otherwise \u2013 is channelled to great effect in this cuisine. A case in point: the Carabineros prawn, red berry tartlet, in which the marriage of the iodine and saline of the shellfish with the fruit is in the realm of the celestial. Meanwhile, the charismatic sommelier has no shortage of savvy wine proposals and the chef's wife deftly illustrates the art of carving at table.",

    "description": "\"The best cookbook ever written was by Mother Nature herself,\" according to Alain Passard. His name is associated with vegetables \u2013 and, for those in the know, a certain beetroot in a salt crust. He called it before anyone else with his 100% vegetable-based menu, initially considered radical. Nowadays, his green philosophy is de rigueur at every restaurant. Despite his success, the chef who fetes fruit and flowers never feels more at home than when in one of his three kitchen gardens in the west of France, where his twin vocations of cook and gardener meet. He heads there for inspiration, exploring the culinary possibilities of vegetables in a bid to elevate this ordinary ingredient so often relegated to the status of a side dish. A bucolic fresco now references this environment in the restaurant's dining room.",

His restaurant occupies a townhouse on the Place des Vosges (antique mirrors, immense tapestry, black and white marble floor), which for all its almost Florentine majesty has just undergone extensive refurbishments (including the addition of remarkable contemporary wall panels lit by red diodes). He never ceases to amaze us with his consistency and that je ne sais quoi that comes from the soul and that he is always able to introduce into his work. His dishes may appear to be simple, but each element is placed with absolute conviction, as in a master's painting. Just let yourself be swept along: emotion shines through in every dish \u2013 lobster fricassee with civet sauce and Saint-Germain mousseline; scallops with leek, potato and truffle; tarte fine sabl\u00e9e with bitter cocoa and vanilla ice cream.",

This native of Orthez (in southwest France) with an enduring love for the Mediterranean is a brilliant chef and businessman. Now a citizen of Monaco, he also heads up an empire of over 30 establishments with a presence on every continent. He was just 33 years old when he was awarded three stars at the Louis\u00a0XV after reaching an astonishing standard. His famous vegetable-based \"Jardins de Provence\" set menu, which launched here in Monaco on 27\u00a0May 1987, has been one of the touchstones of French gastronomy for the last 30 years. Here, Alain Ducasse's signature style is brought to life by his loyal right-hand man, Emmanuel Pilon, in cuisine that masterfully celebrates the essence of the ingredients and the Mediterranean.",

But make no mistake: despite its advanced age, Lameloise does not deal in nostalgia.

His timeless cuisine, ever at the service of outstanding produce, unveils his virtuoso technique and phenomenal delicacy, illustrated by a foaming vin jaune-flavoured butter sauce served with lobster or the delicate cream of cauliflower that flanks sea urchin roe. This lad from Morbihan never ceases to pay tribute to his native Brittany in the heart of Paris, celebrating the region with ingredients like soured milk served with caviar and seabass or salted butter with lobster. On the dessert side, pastry wizard Michael Bartocetti composes a high-flying score inspired by nature, forgoing sugar in favour of fruit and honey. Finally, the service under the auspices of Eric Beaumard (also an outstanding sommelier) is a model of empathy and style that is close to perfection.",

    "description": "The revamped Samaritaine department store is home to the luxurious Cheval Blanc Hotel, within whose walls lies this restaurant, the haunt of low-profile chef, Arnaud Donckele, who has three stars to his name at La Vague d'Or in St Tropez. Wholly committed, he pops in and out of the kitchen to share his passion with diners. His new spin on classical cuisine takes you on a voyage between Normandy, his place of birth, and the Mediterranean, his home of adoption and the Paris region\u2026 It is impossible not to be bowled over by his work, from its delicacy and generosity to the exceptional quality of the ingredients. This virtuoso sauce maker, who can be compared with a perfume \u201cnose\u201d or an oenologist, lavishes phenomenal care and attention over his jus, dressings and sauces which should be tasted first to better appreciate the complex aromatic universe of each dish. When it comes to the sweet course, he can count on Maxime Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, previously of the George V, to take the desserts to a whole new dimension. The absolute pinnacle of fine dining.",

    "description": "In a redesigned interior dominated by a masterful charcoal work, an \"urban cave painting\" depicting a bestiary by the artist Adel Abdessemed, Pierre Gagnaire continues to tinker with the conventions of French cuisine. Named best chef in the world by his peers in 2015, he creates a cuisine d'auteur that is exploratory, comprehensive and excessive. This great lover of jazz and contemporary art never rests on his laurels. Gagnaire's restaurant, which has had three stars since 1996, is made in his image: modern and unfussy, striking a chord of discreet refinement, in perfect harmony with the attentive and delicate service. The poetic dishes are constantly being reinvented, like so many small \"satellite\" portions sent into orbit by the chef, making it impossible to cite an emblematic dish, or even a main characteristic \u2013 beyond excellence.",

    "description": "Emmanuel Renaut fell in love with Haute Savoie as a child, long before achieving his Meilleur Ouvrier de France title, and has an ingrained predilection for Alpine produce (pike, char and whitefish from Lake Geneva, mushrooms and wild herbs, mountain cheeses\u2026). But he does not restrict himself in any way: going against the grain of the regional cooking that is sometimes expected is a source of amusement to him \u2013 a case in point being his superb langoustines marinated in citron, caviar with zesty grapefruit and gentian roots. Plants are also given an increasingly important role in his cooking. The meal would not be complete without a dessert by the talented Aur\u00e9lie Collomb-Clerc, who is just as adept at reinterpreting the house classics (oh, the fir tree souffl\u00e9!) as at dreaming up beautiful creations, such as her elegant white monochrome of Swiss meringue and Alpine milk ice cream, encasing mirabelle compote or orange marmalade, depending on the season. An enchanting high-altitude chalet for the summit of fine dining.",

For example, over 65 types of fish are used in the kitchen, from sea bream, dentex and pike-perch to whiting, comber, and sometimes even moray eel. G\u00e9rald Passedat, heir to a family of artists and once a student of Alain Chapel, the Troisgros brothers and Michel Gu\u00e9rard, has lost none of the pleasure he takes in cooking and in surprising and thrilling diners.

    "description": "You need a raft of superlatives to describe the work of Alexandre Mazzia at AM, his restaurant located in a chic residential area not far from the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. A true artist of a chef who is in perpetual motion, he elevates the small-portion format to the realm of art; he is a virtuoso when it comes to spices, roasting and smoking; his childhood memories of the Congo flow through his cuisine. In his hands, the gastronomic mould as we know it has been broken, but, more importantly, it all makes sense! Take, for instance, his trout roe and wild salmon with smoked milk and roasted hazelnuts \u2013 in which the intensity of flavour is second to none \u2013 or the breaded langoustines with sesame seeds and bonito, a lemon-geranium condiment and seaweed popcorn \u2013 a pure wonder. At each sitting, the lucky few are whisked away on a unique adventure of taste sensations, enhanced by perfect service.",

It's unusual to find spin-offs that manage to live up to the standards set by the original, but that is exactly what has happened in this incredible restaurant, named after the town in which this chef has built his empire.Here, Paolo Casagrande, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of this San Sebastian master, puts his own spin on the exquisite dishes first conceived by his mentor, showcasing them in a more avant-garde setting (undulating ceilings that mimic waves, ethereal lamps that resemble jellyfish, golden tones...). Whether you order \u00e0 la carte menu or opt for one of the various tasting menus, your experience is taken to the next level if you sit at the Chef's Table, an exclusive space where you can watch the chefs in action through a large window.",

His focus is on local and Alpine ingredients showcased on a long and exciting tasting menu: he embraces the limits that the climate and terrain of the Dolomites place on a chef, seeing them as a challenge.

The menu has a broad reach, including specialities from Modena and Emilia (ingredients such as Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar and tagliatelle and tortellini pasta), as well as classic international dishes, which the chef reinterprets with a light and playful touch, reminding us that food should not be a boring ritual but instead an enjoyable experience influenced by memory and culture.

    "description": "This 16C monastery in a secluded and elevated setting overlooking Castel di Sangro has been sympathetically renovated in a manner that fully respects the building\u2019s history, transforming it into a superb restaurant with a splendid terrace and charming guestrooms, while the sublime cuisine served here is as impressive as the magnificent setting. The chef focuses on the essence of his ingredients in dishes which are apparently simple yet often the result of complex preparation and different cooking methods (smoking, the use of essences and extractions etc) so that the unique flavours of the dishes really shine through. An emphasis on healthy cuisine is also apparent: over the years, the cuisine has evolved to include more fish and vegetables (the tasting menu is entirely vegetarian), and less meat and fat. The bread, which the chef has been successfully developing over the past few years, also deserves a special mention thanks to its deliciously moist texture. As the chef himself says, this bread is a course in itself!",

It\u2019s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best ma\u00eetre-d\u2019s in Italy. Annie F\u00e9olde,\u00a0one of the restaurant\u2019s icons, left the reins to the\u00a0highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine.

    "description": "It was Cristoforo Benigno Crespi, the owner of this splendid villa amid the beautiful landscapes of Lake D\u2019Orta, who chose its Moorish style in 1879, creating an exuberant decor of stucco and inlaid wood that conjures up exotic images of the Middle East. Today, careful renovation of the elegant dining rooms and veranda overlooking the garden adds to the charm. However, it was talented chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo who made this villa famous throughout Italy and further afield. This chef from Vico Equense has poured heart and soul into this restaurant (he has even named one of his menus \u201cAnima\u201d, the Italian for \u201csoul\u201d), using all his technical skill and precision to create dishes full of clean and distinct flavours. Two further tasting menus are available: the classic\u00a0Itinerario dal sud al nord Italia (A Journey from southern to northern Italy) and Traccia which explores flavours from Campania up to Piedmont with all the confidence that only truly great chefs can muster. Highly attentive service, plus a wine selection that includes labels from around the world.",

The restaurant\u2019s beating heart is Heinz Beck\u2019s delicate cuisine, which reaches extraordinary heights and could never be described as ordinary. Some of his dishes are bold in style, others more international, but the foundation of his cuisine is always Mediterranean.\u00a0There are two separate wine lists: one dedicated to Italian labels, the other to wines from elsewhere in the world, both featuring some excellent rare bottles, as well as lesser-known labels selected by talented sommelier Marco Reitano.",

Although Piedmontese ingredients are to the fore here (including the region\u2019s famous hazelnuts), the chef also shows himself to be an indefatigable seeker of produce and culinary styles from across the globe. Last but not least, his presentation is always meticulous, showing remarkable aesthetic taste that is reflected in dishes with artistic names, such as his \u201cMatisse panna cotta\u201d and the crunchy hazelnut and cr\u00e8me caramel dessert inspired by an Andy Warhol painting.",

Hidden among the private beach clubs that crowd Senigallia\u2019s seafront, this three-Michelin-starred restaurant comes as a surprise, surrounded as it is by beach parasols and the sound of the sea lapping on the shore. The strength and originality of Uliassi\u2019s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there\u2019s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche\u2019s traditional game dishes, so that the sea and the mountains come together in a perfect reflection of the region\u2019s soul. The dining experience here is enhanced by the owners\u2019 warm welcome: Mauro\u2019s sister Catia and his son Filippo work alongside the chef. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the restaurant is doing its bit for the local environment by banning the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish.",

The top-notch ingredients he uses reflect a close affinity with Switzerland. Bold and full of contrasts, honest and accessible \u2013 this is the kind of food you wish you came across more often!

You can sense the passion of this Grisons native in the variety of aperitif snacks and amuse-bouches, which amount to a comprehensive insight into the range of this chef's cuisine in all its creativity and finesse. What's more, this does not rely on typical luxury fare, but is drawn almost exclusively from what the Graub\u00fcnden region has to offer \u2013 in the best quality version thereof! Some ingredients come from their own vegetable garden; the bread is from their bakery and they roast their own coffee in a small roastery. There are great wine pairings or non-alcoholic options to accompany the meal. An interesting booklet provides information about the site, the Caminada family and the produce. The guestrooms are as sophisticated as the cuisine.",

    "description": "When the definitive history of NYC's dining scene is written, Le Bernardin will have a chapter all to itself. Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert\u2019s icon has been entertaining the city\u2019s movers and shakers for over 20 years and its popularity remains undimmed.As soon as you step inside you are enveloped in a warm embrace. Lunch is busy with those who know what they want and trust this well-oiled machine to deliver it in the time they have. Come at dinner for a more languid affair. The menu is divided into headings of \u201cAlmost raw,\u201d \u201cBarely touched\u201d and \u201cLightly cooked,\u201d but don\u2019t be fooled, these product-driven items have considerable depth. Seafood restaurants have no hiding place when it comes to cooking fish or crustaceans and this kitchen always hits its marks\u2014whether that\u2019s poaching halibut, pan-roasting monkfish, baking striped bass or searing tuna.While seafood remains Ripert's passion, his vegetarian tasting menu makes waves with dishes like the Himalayan morel, spring pea and fava bean casserole or the warm artichoke panach\u00e9 with vegetable risotto and P\u00e9rigord black truffle vinaigrette. Bid this spread adieu over coconut mousse with shavings of caramelized pineapple.",

Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at the ready.Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef\u2019s signature glass coupe of minced toro and a very fine\u2014and generous\u2014pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is wondrous, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin white truffle.",

The freshly baked, delicately crisped vegan roll presented with faux butter is a magical creation. A quenelle of tonburi, mimicking caviar, plated with horseradish cream and accompanied by a radish tostada with a swipe of pumpkin seed butter is simply stunning. Toothsome braised seitan, wrapped in spinach and dressed with morels, is amplified with luscious sauce work.\u00a0Desserts, perhaps a frozen cherry blossom and rose confection dressed with strawberries, are equally accomplished.",

    "description": "Set 90 minutes from DC in a town whose very existence seems tied to the restaurant, this is a destination in every sense of the word. Embellished to the very last inch, the dining room resembles a jewel box lined with patterned carpets, lush wallpaper and shimmering fabrics.The restaurant may be over 40 years old, but Chef Patrick O\u2019Connell\u2019s cuisine shines as brightly as ever. Each menu has a\u00a0unique focus, as in the \u201cGastronaut\" and \u201cThe Good Earth,\u201d offering superb vegetarian items. Guests can also graze through the menus to get a full sense of what the team can do. Sauces work a particular magic, as evidenced by the truffle-infused tartar with morel \u201ccrabcake.\u201d Desserts, like coconut sorbet with ginger granit\u00e9, are perfection.",

The meal meets its\u00a0dramatic\u00a0end with a \"Paint\" dessert\u2014think of a Pollock-esque creation\u00a0with blueberries and\u00a0a liquid N2-frozen block of chocolate mousse smashed to bits.",
