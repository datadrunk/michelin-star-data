    "description": "Bas van Kranen has transformed Bord'Eau into Flore, a restaurant entirely devoted to his philosophy of \"conscious fine dining\". The many natural features lend individuality to the contemporary comfort of the decor. And that is no accident. His fascinating and original approach to nature emphasises vegetables, local produce and sustainability. Biodynamic growers have become regular suppliers and the chef has also banished all dairy products from his kitchen. His search for solutions feeds his creativity and has resulted in a very pure style of cooking.Each dish has surprises in store. The small plates keep you on your toes up to the very last bite. Chef Van Kranen gives oysters from the Eastern Scheldt a twist by combining them with seaweed and a deeply aromatic dashi bouillon. Quail is boned and all its meat cut out. The bird is then stuffed again before being cooked to perfection. It is juicy, having been slowly roasted in butter, ready to be served with fine seasonal vegetables and a powerful, subtly sweetened sauce. Bas van Kranen's cuisine has personality, and he clearly takes pride in working with Dutch produce. He also has the confidence to cook just the way he wants to.",

    "description": "The domain of Ch\u00e2teau Wittem is one of those places that gives you a special feeling as soon as you cross its threshold. A charming national monument dating back to the 11C, the castle exudes classical elegance from the outside (the terrace in the greenery is magnificent); inside, you are immersed in a world of modern luxury. But it is chef Guido Braeken's talent that takes the experience to the next level. This is a chef who knows how to get the best out of extraordinary produce. Norwegian langoustines, for example, are presented at the table before being roasted, combined with an exotic tandoori masala cream, coconut, a yellow curry foam and an intense jus made from the crustacean with tomato, tandoori and honey. What a sophisticated and modern tribute to the produce! Chef Braeken's talent lies in the delicacy of his dishes. Technique and instinct go hand in hand, along with a battery of intense flavours from around the globe. The precise balance of each ingredient feeds into expressive, lively flavours. At Julemont, you will experience bespoke cuisine with youthful exuberance.",

    "description": "De Lindenhof offers a unique experience that starts with the location: a splendid farmhouse with a thatched roof that exudes character and elegance. The English garden is magnificent. Out back is the chef's little sailing boat, in which he likes to cruise the canals (sometimes taking guests with him!). There are also luxurious guestrooms for a relaxing stay. But the main draws are the enthusiastic service provided by hostess Marjan and the ingredient-led cuisine of Martin Kruithof, a traditional chef who has moved with the times. When he incorporates international influences and creative ideas, he never loses his sense of control and tends to stick to classic flavours. The quality of the produce is impressively showcased, and his dishes are presented in such a way that you can see exactly what you're eating. The sweet/salty flavour of exceptionally delicious crab, for instance, is subtly emphasised by the addition of mayonnaise and an iceberg lettuce granita for a sharper finish. A fine julienne of lettuce is mixed with a Japanese vinaigrette and dots of ponzu and grapefruit gel to add depth and exotic nuances. This is a wonderfully simple take on refined cuisine! What a pleasure it is to be spoiled by Martin Kruithof.",

    "description": "Everything revolves around luxury and opulence at this restaurant. On the way to your table, for example, you step past the cheese store (the cheese trolley is excellent!), champagne is presented on a special cart. The vibrant decor is complemented by finishings made of the finest materials, as innovative design meets modern elegance. Chef Mustert's cuisine is equally tasteful. For example, he elevates langoustines of exceptional quality in a combination with various types of melon, subtle hints of celery and both a foamy butter sauce and curry oil. The results are pared down, intense and incredibly rich! Fred Mustert's creations are exciting and everything is precisely balanced. You will want to mop up every last drop of the sauces with your bread. With a sure hand, he gives classic flavour combinations an original twist. Chef Mustert delivers culinary perfection, curated in a very appealing menu. Less really is more with Fred!",

    "description": "As soon as you step into this quintessential canal house in the centre of Amsterdam, Richard van Oostenbrugge and Thomas Groot draw you into their world. There is something theatrical about the sight of the chefs working meticulously in their open kitchen. There is an enchanting intimacy and luxurious comfort about Restaurant 212. Nothing is left to chance here, and that goes for the attentive service, too. Fun fact: On the ceiling, you can still see marks from the champagne that was uncorked when this place was awarded its first MICHELIN star. With their inventiveness and classical know-how (those sauces!), both chefs put their own stamp on their creations. An ingredient will undergo the most surprising of transformations, and it all seems to happen with such ease \u2013 therein lies the chefs' originality. Breton lobster, for example, is poached in zolderspek (aged smoky bacon) jelly, combined with a fine vin jaune sauce, a very reduced bisque caramel, lobster coral gnocchi and aromatic black truffle. The simplicity of this cuisine is what makes it so ingenious! Nothing is overdone, and nothing is lacking. The real stars of this show are the extraordinary produce and the talent of two friends.",

At De Librije, he developed his own inventive culinary style, and at Amber (Hong Kong) he mastered the sophisticated techniques particular to Asian cuisine. His food looks as spectacular as it tastes \u2013 exciting and colourful with a unique interplay of textures.First-class Dutch produce and international seasonings come together here in complex dishes. The technically gifted chef does not shy away from contrasts, and he is certainly an innovator rather than an imitator! This applies to his vegetarian set menu as well as to his fish and meat creations. His combination of crispy duck tongue, blue lobster and foie gras with liquorice and green apple is simply amazing. At Spectrum, every bite creates a new impression that increases the desire for more.This typical canal house enchants visitors with its understated class and beautiful elegance.

    "description": "Jurgen van der Zalm has made the kitchen at Vinkeles his own. For years, he was the right-hand man of Dennis Kuipers, who gave him a grounding in classic culinary techniques. Today he is doing things his way, without breaking with the house style: premium-quality ingredients and rich sauces are still the name of the game.For example, he fills morels with a delicate farce fine made with poulet noir, but what really raises the bar is his vin jaune sauce with subtle notes of tarragon \u2013 the intensity and depth of flavour are second to none! We should also mention the amazing carcass sauce he serves with his plump langoustine combined with Nashi pear and mint for a burst of freshness. Chef Van der Zalm is a master saucier who clearly has an eye for detail. In his highly personal creations, he combines a playful approach to international influences, an exciting sense of creativity and a respect for tradition. Whether cooking with premium produce or conjuring up vegetarian delights, his dishes make an impact.A unique experience awaits you in the former bakery of this 18C Roman Catholic almshouse, where the original wood and stone have been incorporated into a modern interior.",

    "description": "Parkheuvel was the first Dutch restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars. Having taken over the reins from Cees Helder, Erik van Loo has kept the restaurant's fantastic reputation intact. A table in this elegant pavilion in Rotterdam's Park, with a spectacular view of the river Maas (the terrace is a must), is the ideal setting in which to indulge in a wonderful fine dining experience. Erik van Loo is, after all, a chef with a feel for classic finesse. He proves this, for example, with his lobster cream sauce, full bodied and rich, taking his well-known combination of Bresse chicken and langoustine ravioli to the next level. At Parkheuvel, it is the sauces that really bowl diners over. Furthermore, his son Juli\u00ebn's input adds detail and diversity as he brings his youthful energy to the table in the preparation of the dishes. For instance, he combines various textures of mango with the freshness of bergamot, green sorrel, Pernod and a perfectly risen souffl\u00e9. You can certainly consider the sommelier's astute recommendations and amazing collection as the icing on the cake. Parkheuvel's tradition of excellence in fine dining is perpetuated with passion.",

    "description": "Hans van Wolde has reinvented himself. For years the face of Beluga, he is making a fresh start at Brut172. He has set up shop in the heart of the quiet Limburg countryside, having transformed a farmstead into an architectural gem. Diners are led through the different spaces, from the aperitif lounge to the cosy salon to the kitchen itself. The upscale modern design is extraordinary. This is art rather than architecture! Hans van Wolde takes you into his world, where you momentarily lose track of time. Ingredients of exceptional quality and intensely flavoured sauces characterise the dishes. Diners cannot fail to be impressed by the way a fillet of pickled sea bass is taken to a whole new level by the addition of a langoustine broth, Spanish spring onion, leek oil and fried shrimp. This restaurant is a celebration of both culinary expertise and the local terroir. And rather than resting on his laurels, chef Van Wolde combines his talent with a sense of adventure, putting his own intensely aromatic and technically precise spin on a classic apple pie, for example, or adding a dash of Asian flair to scallops. Then there is the selection of wines from around the globe as well as a range of delicious juices for alcohol-free pairings\u2026 Brut172 makes for a first-class dining experience!",

    "description": "Over the last few years, ma\u00eetre d' Milica Trajkovska Scheiber and head chef Jochim Busch have established a restaurant where diners can feel at home. In this outwardly rather unassuming building in Westend, you can expect food with plenty of character! This is modern cuisine that stands out for its individuality. Jochim Busch has the chutzpah to drastically pare down his dishes, which feature a beautiful interplay of contrasts and textures. A responsible approach to resources is really important to him, which is why selected regional and seasonal produce is the name of the game. The stylish, sleek and modern interior is of an equally high standard. Pleasantly unpretentious atmosphere; friendly, courteous and professional service. Insider tip: Some tables afford a good view of the kitchen pass!",

This marvellous resort is also home to a fantastic fine dining restaurant. Head chef Martin Herrmann celebrates the classics while remaining open to modern innovations. He cooks up an eight-course set menu, which you can also trim down to a shorter version. The appealingly pared-back dishes are prepared using high-quality ingredients, and the sauces are a real highlight! Then there is the elegant setting and magnificent views through the floor-to-ceiling windows, as well as the relaxed yet stylish service and knowledgeable wine recommendations.

    "description": "In a district in the northwest of the city, not far from the Pegnitz and its meadows, Felix Schneider is now cooking up a storm in this restaurant somewhat tucked away in a back courtyard (access via Kirschgartenstra\u00dfe\u00a06). The inventive dishes are born of the team's focus on sustainability, which means they grow their own fruit and vegetables and produce everything themselves, from ham to butter and miso to vinegar. Modern urban surroundings make for a pleasantly laid-back atmosphere. Bag a table near the open kitchen and you can chat to the chefs, who also deliver the food themselves. From 6.15pm you can tuck into a set menu (fish and meat or vegetarian) comprising 12 to 16 courses, to be enjoyed over four to five hours. Choose between wine and alcohol-free pairings.",

Each begins with an array of amuse-bouches and is rounded off with a series of equally delicate petits fours. In between you might opt for Iberico Secreto with shellfish, chorizo, pearl onion and Dijon mustard. With his great taste and considerable technical prowess he prepares premium ingredients, creating exceptionally interesting flavour combinations.

Having trained at the \u00d6schberghof, this young native of Donaueschingen travelled further afield, working in kitchens in Lech am Arlberg and Baiersbronn, before returning to work in his home town when the hotel owners decided to open this elegant fine dining restaurant. Manuel Ulrich puts a skilful spin on classical cuisine, adding a perfectly judged dash of modern innovation to his balanced and yet robust dishes. The \"Noir\" and \"Vert\" (vegetarian) set menus propose real depth of flavour. You can count on first-rate service from sommelier Michael H\u00e4ni's front-of-house team.",

In the kitchen, Sebastian Frank gives free rein to his own unique style, which is perhaps all the more remarkable for its apparent lack of fanfare.

    "description": "This stately home estate dating back to 1896 makes for a wonderful setting with its romantic grounds dotted with old trees, its pond and its tantalising glimpses of the Baltic Sea. It goes without saying that in summer you will want to enjoy the fabulous views from the terrace. Head chef Christian Scharrer selects the best ingredients the market has to offer and transforms them into intensely flavoured, creative dishes, as in, for example, langostinos with autumn cabbage and truffle or scallop with fennel and bouillabaisse. And as you might expect from a stately home, diners are seated in sumptuous surroundings boasting stylish details such as chandeliers, wall paintings and stucco. Then there is the attentive and accomplished service provided by your cordial hostess, Nathalie Scharrer, and her professional front-of-house team.",

The cuisine has its own style, which is certainly unique: Ren\u00e9 Frank and his team focus on patisserie techniques, using them to prepare innovative dishes. The food is by no means limited to sweet treats. From 7pm, you are invited to embark on a culinary adventure in 15 courses. Relaxed and professional service.

    "description": "Thierry Theys\u2019 cuisine is the pinnacle of \u201cnuanced\u201d. Despite his youth, he has already made a name for himself on the Belgian gastronomic scene and owes his reputation to his highly individual recipes. Right from the very first bite, he unveils his high-flying precision and technical craftsmanship. Not afraid of challenges, each dish is rich in emotion. For example, he may prepare langoustine with a pop-corn crust, served with red beetroot, sumac and a beurre blanc. He adds a new dimension to a perfectly pink loin of hare served with a champagne beurre blanc. This chef knows how to nurture and draw out the distinctive character of outstanding ingredients, down to the tiniest detail. Suave, delicate food that suits our modern tastebuds. The mind-blowing experience is further enhanced by a fantastic selection of wines, available by the glass, a decadent range of sweet titbits served with coffee and super slick service. The stylish interior, a masterclass in good taste, provides the perfect foil to this exceptional establishment.",

    "description": "A meal crafted by Gert de Mangeleer and sommelier Joachim Bouden is in a class entirely of its own. First the elegant Botanic Hotel, which immerses you in a world unlike any other, depicted by concrete materials and muted shades of grey that paint a soothing portrait of almost speechless beauty. In a bid to maintain the surprise effect, the establishment asks guests not to post photos on social media, which is why we won\u2019t dwell on the amazing chef\u2019s table at which diners are served. Suffice to say that chef De Mangeleer\u2019s love affair with Asia is even more pronounced than ever. The knife-edge precision and boundless creativity of the chef who painstakingly crafts and assembles unlikely ingredients remain his hallmark. For example, he may combine a premium ingredient such as wagyu A5 beef with smoked eel and cherries. The chef\u2019s talent shines through in his flair for sophistication and mixing unusual ideas with the goal of enhancing taste and flavour. He invents techniques and jazzes up classical recipes with his own inimitable stamp. A truly unforgettable experience.",

The restaurant overlooking the cottage garden is the pinnacle of luxurious elegance. Chef Devalkeneer leaves his personal hallmark on each dish, blending classicism and creativity with consummate flair and talent. He scours the countryside of Belgium and France for the best ingredients from Aveyron lamb to abalone from the Brittany coast, further enhancing these exceptional ingredients with fascinating side dishes. For example, the exquisite flavour of Brittany crab is subtly underscored by a mint and coriander pesto, almonds and different textures of courgettes. His deep-seated understanding of the role and impact of each ingredient enables him to create combinations that intelligently enrich and exalt the original flavour. This chalet in the forest is a temple of high-flying culinary art that will surprise you over and over again.",

    "description": "La Paix, a culinary landmark of Brussels since 1892, was originally where the local butchers came for a bite to eat after their working day. Times have changed and chef David Martin has swapped the traditional brasserie score for a brand-new menu that is as impressive as the d\u00e9cor. La Paix now blends Brussels\u2019 heritage with Japanese minimalism, depicted by a shimmering flock of origami birds hanging from the ceiling and soft lighting, setting an almost reverential vibe, while Martin and his team add the final touch to their creations on the \u201caltar\u201d. You can choose between two formulas, named after the respective fathers of the chef and the lady of the house, which pair polished pedigree Gallicism with Japanese purity, creating a distinctive gastronomic signature. Chef Martin is on a permanent quest for perfection and the flavours are often bold, sometimes even disruptive. He enjoys surprising diners right from the appetisers, with, for example, pig\u2019s ears cooked in a hint of soy sauce with moist steamed mussels in a vinaigrette based on mussel stock. He masterfully works with dashi, miso and koji, adding a surprising new kick to noble ingredients such as monkfish or turbot. Martin\u2019s inimitable character and steadfast commitment can be tasted in every bite of his subtle recipes that seek to encapsulate the microcosm of Belgium!",

    "description": "Ralf Berendsen aims to provide a global experience, starting with the tree-lined drive to this classy modern building flanked by an opulent terrace, in which every detail has been puzzled and preened over! Even before the first bite, you are engulfed by the feeling of luxury as a birthright\u2026 Ralf, a true perfectionist, now makes his entrance. He spices up familiar flavours with delicate nuances and subtle international produce. Fabulous, rare ingredients such as hamachi and Polder\u2019s hare are flawlessly prepared, but the chef also enjoys surprising us with bold associations. For example, his melt-in-the-mouth fillet of venison is set off by a concoction of taggiasca olives and the tangy sweetness of pineapple. The fascinating balance of these powerful flavours demonstrates the full gamut of this high-flying chef\u2019s talent, particularly visible in his sauces. Discerning foodies will be further delighted to learn that Ralf was a baker-pastry chef in a former life, hence the irresistible bread and biscuit trolley.",

Admire the cheerful chefs seamlessly working together in the theatrically visible kitchen. The seats (only 18) around the counter are reserved for amateurs of high-flying cuisine. There is a single set 6-course menu and Sandra can be relied upon for judicious wine-food pairings, delving into a splendid cellar which boasts a knock-out selection of wines by the glass. The cast of exceptional ingredients features stars such as wagyu beef, turbot, langoustine, all of which are crafted with awe-inspiring know-how. Creative, bang-on recipes designed to showcase the produce: oysters, wagyu and lemon explode in a festival of flavour or textbook-perfect fluffy souffl\u00e9 of langoustines, subtly flanked by caviar.

In the company of his executive cheffe, Cassandre Ercolini, he raises ancestral culinary techniques to the rank of art. It is impossible not to be enthralled by his calm, high-precision gestures as he appropriates the mythical p\u00e2t\u00e9 en cro\u00fbte and pithiviers recipe (by reservation only). This perfectionist seeks to communicate his emotions with each dish.His puff pastry creations are presented to the diner before going into the oven in this inclusive experience. Each bite is a moment of sheer bliss from the rich, crunchy pastry to the unctuous filling (for example, sweetbread, foie gras, Corr\u00e8ze veal, cabbage and black trumpet mushrooms), further underscored by a harmonious jus. Searingly good food! Subtle interpretations that revive the classics of French and Belgian cuisine. Chef Torosyan aims for delicacy and reaches dizzying heights of intensity.Each dish is a masterpiece of artistry, with no detail left to chance, which is also the case of the interior. This magnificent restaurant is emblematic of Victor Horta\u2019s Art nouveau architecture. Karen Torosyan has found his place at Bozar.",

Chef Florian Favario adds an increasingly creative spin to cuisine based on the best of local produce (eg lamb and piglets, home-grown vegetables, seasonal fruit). He masterfully combines wildflowers, plants and herbs, such as thyme, sage, oregano, agastache, hyssop, mint flower etc. The resulting feast of extraordinary scents elevates dishes that are already at the apex of culinary technique and know-how. These detailed dishes, presented in walnut tableware designed by the chef himself, are brought out of the kitchen by a crack team led by an attentive Sandrine, the chef's wife. A drink before dinner on the terrace is the perfect opportunity to take in the view of the mountain pastures.",

Perched high up on the flank of a rocky hillside in a medieval village, this place commands stunning views of the C\u00f4te d'Azur hinterland and the glinting Mediterranean. When it comes to the food, there is plenty to get enthusiastic about. Drawing on delicious produce sourced in the area (fish, meat, vegetables, olive oil and herbs) and all the talent we associate with him, Arnaud Faye creates harmonious and precise dishes that are often irresistible.",

    "description": "One cannot help but be impressed by the trajectory of Takao Takano's career. Originally from Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, he didn't stick with his law studies for long, instead devoting himself to his true passion: cooking. Since 2013, he has been plying his trade in this elegant, pared-back restaurant located in the 6th arrondissement of Lyon. And if it has proved to be a hit with diners ever since opening, it is thanks to the original and refined dishes, which delight and surprise at the same time. They certainly fulfil the objective that the chef has set himself: \"Keep it simple and delicious\". Let's linger for a moment over the perfectly cooked fillet of Arctic char with crayfish tails, chanterelles and Chamb\u00e9ry vermouth, or the Poitou pigeon with Jerusalem artichokes, guanciale and Vaucluse truffle... Intelligently devised dishes replete with beautifully balanced flavours: that's Takao Takano down to a T.",

He holds three professional qualifications (in cooking, charcuterie and pastry-making, no less!) and was named Meilleur Ouvrier de France in 2007. Based in Lyon since 2014, he showcases his qualities as a chef day in, day out: subtle inventiveness, precision in his marriages of flavours, and of course an irreproachable choice of ingredients. For example, his \"oyster and razor clam in a peaty jelly, winter tartine and coffee cloud\" is a marvel that succeeds in combining the aromas of seafood, undergrowth and roasting. A coherent and demanding dish in which everything is placed deliberately: to be savoured with all one's senses alert, as if listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony.",

Don't be distracted by the enchanting view of the bay, or the location of this superb hotel \u2013 it is on the plate that the most amazing things happen! Chef Fabio Bragagnolo is inspired by both Corsica and Italy. Among his favourite dishes are the cannelloni dentex with crab, caviar, fresh vegetables and citrons from San Giuliano. The raw fish, cut into thin strips, is filled with crumbled crabmeat and topped with a small scoop of caviar for a dash of iodine flavour. The fresh sensation on the taste buds is insane.

In a felicitous demonstration of culinary balance, the sauces receive extra special care, illustrated by a gutsy jus of fermented c\u00e8pes, a foaming beurre blanc flavoured with dill or a poultry and salsify jus with peat whisky.

By virtue of farming traditions and the harsh climate, the restaurant doesn\u2019t mess about with hospitality, albeit in a modern vein. The chef scrupulously applies the advice of his mentor, Michel Bras: only cook local ingredients (\u2026) with an identity. He does just this, showcasing a giant c\u00e8pe picked in the next-door woods or the legendary Aubrac beef rich in the flavour of a thousand flowers, all of which is served in \u201chis ecosystem\u201d.

He adds just the right dose of inventiveness and energy, illustrated by his new take on eggs meurette and his steadfast commitment to freshwater fish (perch, black bass, pike, zander) depicted by brook trout, zander and river fish soup. Meals are served in a distinctive interior featuring light wood cladding, grape vine motifs and mustard yellow swivel Shark chairs - each design choice is a nod to Burgundy's heritage. Inspired and accomplished cuisine peppered with influences from near and far.",

    "description": "Eug\u00e9nie Brazier (1895-1977), an exceptional chef who inspired an entire branch of French cuisine, obtained three stars in two different establishments. It is in her Lyon restaurant, on rue Royale, that Mathieu Viannay gives his take on the Brazier \"legend\". In a magnificent hybrid decor, 1930s stained glass windows and mouldings are blended with Saarinen Tulip chairs (a bold design move!) and the chef pays a vibrant tribute to the iconic dishes once served on the premises (Bresse chicken with truffles, crispy pike bread, a stunning Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9), infusing them with his talent and novel ideas. Be sure to try the lunch menu, which represents the best value for money. When it comes to dessert, pastry chef Rodolphe Tronc, who has worked for Pierre Gagnaire among others, takes no prisoners with his remarkable technique and his eye for detail, especially when it comes to his delightfully old-fashioned Norwegian omelette.

The \"self-taught chef\", as he calls himself, is a remarkable character: an entrepreneur, blogger, food critic and now even an author. In his open kitchen facing the customers, he is a charismatic orator, talking about his suppliers and his desire to take a back seat to the artisans who produce what he cooks \u2013 on that note, when it comes to either the recipes or the ingredients, the chef considers himself above all a \"middle man\". Everything is made to order, with garnishes and sauces designed with just one thing in mind: to elevate the ingredient without distorting it. The deliberately short menu presents atypical compositions (some with equally unusual names): homard \u00e0 croquer presque vivant sur son rocher (\"lobster so fresh it's practically alive on its rock\"); red mullet Rossini (and its succulent sauce); pink praline tart made according to Henry Cornil's recipe for Alain Chapel.",

Of course, all this would be worth nothing without high-calibre cuisine. No worries on that score: chef Christian Sinicropi, a local man, has matters entirely in hand. At each stage of the \"Mouvements\" set menu, he homes in on one ingredient, supporting it with elements from its own ecosystem. The result is coherent and sophisticated, right down to the remarkably precise desserts by Julien Ochando. Definitely worthy of a Golden Palm award.",

    "description": "The fortified Cit\u00e9 M\u00e9di\u00e9vale is part of the time-honoured heritage of Carcassonne and its region\u2026 and the same could almost be said of Franck Putelat. In his place at the foot of the ramparts of the medieval town, this native of the Jura, who has made the Aude d\u00e9partement his home, cooks the produce from his large (one hectare) vegetable garden, in line with his culinary concept of \"classic-fiction\". This translates into a clever rendering of the old gourmet hits, which the chef revisits according to what inspires him on that day. Three examples that have become iconic are his parmentier with sea fig, cassoulet with pigeon supreme and pigeon leg sausage, and bouillabaisse with duck foie gras. Appetising visuals, flavour and finesse, to be savoured in a lively atmosphere, in the company of a very diverse clientele. Pastry chef Alexis Pocinho crafts a particularly balanced selection of sweets. There are four rooms available for overnight guests.",

The chef gives full expression to the scope and breadth of his experience and know-how, executing timeless signature cuisine that finds its source in historical cookbooks of French gastronomy (the chef is said to own one of the finest cookery libraries of Paris). There is no carte but a tasting menu that tours the regions of France and revolves around Pi\u00e8ge\u2019s \"mijot\u00e9s modernes\". This consummate chef demonstrates his creative talent and ability to provoke culinary emotion and taste without falling foul of the temptation to needlessly showcase his skills \u2026 He thus surprises us with a dish that is the epitome of simplicity, such as his succulent langoustine, seared on a Parisian paving stone and flanked by delicate seaweed and a buckwheat sabayon.",

Here, he has taken things to another level, with six dining rooms adorned with contemporary paintings and sculptures (many lent by Fran\u00e7ois Pinault) and with old-fashioned windows overlooking the Seine. The splendour of the backdrop in no way distracts the chef from his mission, which is to pay tribute to French cuisine every day.

He prepares his dishes with superb ingredients (some of which you may never even have heard of, let alone tasted), never straying from his solid classical foundations.

His cuisine embraces one tradition after another with disconcerting ease \u2013 Alsace, the United States, Brittany and Japan. Confident in his strengths, he has a no-holds-barred approach \u2013 as in, for example, his Breton lobster cooked in a Cona coffee maker and served with basil pasta and lobster nem, or lemon souffl\u00e9 with tarragon and olive oil ice cream... not to mention the trolley decked with exquisite bite-sized desserts.

It embodies the Alsatian inn in all its glory \u2013 an inviting and friendly place, untouched by the passage of time, where every customer is welcomed like a member of the family\u2026 It is an institution in the region, but also renowned throughout France and beyond! Since it was established in 1882 (between S\u00e9lestat and Riquewihr), the restaurant has made a name for itself thanks to its matelote with riesling and dishes based on local game. Marc Haeberlin, grandson of the founders, now serves the classical repertoire (foie gras terrine served by the spoonful, frog\u2019s leg mousseline, salmon souffl\u00e9) alongside more modern creations. The legend lives on.",

In his contemporary location \u2013 all stone, iron and glass \u2013 in a medieval fortress with a 360\u00b0 view of the surroundings, he is playing in the big league.

Le Pr\u00e9, in Clermont-Ferrand, is the epitome of simplicity \u2013 he draws on pork, eggs or peas, which are not necessarily ingredients that make your mouth water! But they are crafted with breathtaking technical skill: forget the menu and the seasons, and let yourself be swept along by instinctive cuisine that is moulded into poetic-sounding set menus \u2013 \"Parfums des Pr\u00e9s\", \"Printemps dans nos Montagnes\". And let's not forget the involvement of the 200 plants or wild herbs that grow around the volcanoes, nor the local snails served in a jus made with freshly picked linden. Chef Xavier Beaudiment is reason enough to visit Clermont-Ferrand.",

This small restaurant has a delightfully pared-back and contemporary interior with bay windows looking out onto a charming Japanese garden. The setting is in perfect harmony with the cuisine of Kazuyuki Tanaka, a Japanese chef and former second-in-command to R\u00e9gis Marcon. He crafts elegant and creative dishes that are rife with different flavours and influences. Each one surprises in terms of the quality of the ingredients, technical mastery and aesthetics. Aromatic herbs, vegetables, plants and condiments are savvily incorporated. Fine wine list, including 250 champagnes.",

Back then it attracted workers and locals, who came for simple and invigorating fare \u2013 soup, vol-au-vents, leg of lamb. Under the impetus of Olivier Bellin, who returned in 1998, the transformation of this family-run Auberge was complete: inventive and versatile, the chef came into his own, brandishing an increasingly strong culinary personality. He works with an extraordinary network of carefully selected small-scale producers in Finist\u00e8re, and there is a card on each table listing where each ingredient is from and who produced it. His dishes marry sea and land as if they were the most natural of partners: potato souffl\u00e9 stuffed with oyster jus; langoustine and pig's trotter; cheese tortellini and trout eggs. ",

    "description": "This is the \"contemporary French fine dining\" restaurant at The Peninsula, a luxury hotel located near the Arc de Triomphe. It is named after the plane in which Nungesser and Coli attempted the first North Atlantic crossing in 1927, and a life-size replica of the plane is affixed to the top of the hotel, as if poised to take to the skies before your very eyes. A fine tribute to the two aviation pioneers, as well as to the sky over Paris! Perched above the rooftops and encased in glass, the restaurant feels like it is in flight over the capital, while the terrace offers a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur. A perfect setting in which to sample the fine cuisine of chef David Bizet, which hits the nail on the head in all respects: cooking, jus and sauces, visuals. As for the desserts, pastry chef Anne Coruble treats our taste buds to the fruits of her talents. A great success.",

Not only did they attend the same hotel school in Nice (and sit exams in the same room) and both train at the Negresco during Alain Llorca's time there, but they also share the same motivation to run their own place, delivering good, honest, tasty fare. The result of this fraternal alliance is Flaveur, a project into which they ploughed all their energy to the point of receiving a Michelin star in 2011, and a second one in 2018.How might the \"Tourteaux touch\" be summed up? A certain kind of confidence, boldness and measured risk-taking. For example, when it comes to local ingredients and spices from afar, it's not either/or, it's both! A scorpion fish from Nice comes up against a fish broth enhanced with vadouvan, a heavily aromatic blend of Indian spices... They often go out on a limb, but the risk always pays off. Fine and masterful cuisine with character from start to finish. Bravo!",

    "description": "Few chefs show such a strong culinary personality as Alexandre Gauthier in La Madelaine-sous-Montreuil (near the northern tip of France). The story unfolds in a space with two tiered metal rooftops (designed by architect Patrick Bouchain) and views onto the verdant surroundings and the kitchens. This is the laboratory in which the chef cooks up \"contemporary cuisine with French roots, liberated from its certainties and preconceptions\". Like an alchemist, he teases out flavours in on-point dishes, each a vignette of creativity in which the ingredients sing the praises of the seasons. Artistic and experimental cuisine, to be savoured in this old Picardy farmhouse imbued with a luxury that remains close to nature.",

An avid sportsman, the chef serves fine cuisine that is also healthy and light. Herbs, flowers and wild plants bring contrasts and colours to his creative and incisive dishes, which are a delicious roll call of fish from the lake. For example, the \"Omble chevalier beurre ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel \u00e0 l'\u00e9pic\u00e9a\" (Arctic char with a remarkable spruce butter) or the precisely prepared and extremely fresh smoked whitefish. The wine list includes a separate booklet entirely dedicated to the wines located within the limits of the former duchy of Savoy. This poetic experience unfolds in an elegant contemporary dining space that opens out onto the terrace and takes in the silvery shores of Lake Annecy, the cleanest lake in Europe. An exceptional foil for this slick and bold gastronomy.",

The flavours come thick and fast; the emotion often sneaks up on you, and you can almost hear the earth sing as you tuck into certain dishes. If you would like to stay over, lovely guestrooms with bay windows looking out onto the Aveyron countryside await you.

Lobster with tarragon orange vinaigrette; Arctic char cooked over an open flame, pulp of C\u00e9vennes sweet onions; chocolate piano, grilled coffee sauce. Note the great deal to be had with the lunch menu (a real bargain) and the service that is attentive down to the smallest detail, continuing in the tradition of the great French establishments.",

The menu begins with a sip of house-infused sake and small bites, winding through delicate aromatic broths, sashimi courses and heartier fare like grilled fish accented with sansho pepper. The only dish to never leave the menu, an artful twirl of al dente spaghetti dressed with tender abalone, pickled cod roe and black truffle, exemplifies Chef Nakayama\u2019s unconventional approach.",

    "description": "Sushi Ginza Onodera may have outposts around the world, but its fame has not diluted the exemplary quality. Instead of the reverent sushi counter, it's a hive of activity; one that comes with a hefty price tag, though their strictly enforced no-tipping policy helps.\u00a0Surprises and delights abound in the delirious array of courses, starting with an earthenware cup of chawanmushi topped with Italian caviar and a petal of uni. Some might feel guilty devouring squid in a matter of seconds after watching the exacting chefs take ten minutes to prepare it, but the experience is utterly memorable. The nigiri are a clear highlight here, revealing tiger shrimp with miso, sea perch seared for a hint of smoke as well as a duo of anago with shanso and yuzu zest.The signature matcha- and coconut-panna cotta is a delectable finale.",

Playing with shapes, textures and flavours, the chefs exhibit an indisputable craftsmanship. Moreover, a constant stream of innovations emerges from their laboratory, such as their \"solid bubbles\" or, even more remarkably, a \"living table\" that changes as the meal progresses (by reservation only). Two tasting menus are proposed: \"Classic\", comprising the signature dishes of the house, and \"Festival\", which showcases the latest seasonal creations.

The staging is also impressive, with many of the unusual dishes being finished at the table or even by guests themselves!

The entrance, embellished with striking Murano glass, provides a sense of the theatrical before heading into the dining room, which is decorated in an elegant array of golden, white and blue tones. Its impressive windows, which open out towards the coast and infinite Atlantic vistas, are equally striking.Austrian-born chef Hans Neuner has taken Portugal\u2019s voyages of discovery through its history as his leitmotif here, hence the flavours on the \u201cIndia Route\u201d (Rota da \u00cdndia) tasting menu which showcases a journey that starts in Portugal, passes through Africa (Cape Verde, Ghana, Mozambique etc) and culminates in Goa on the coast of India.",

There are two modern, creative tasting menus (\"Voro\" and \"Devoro\") that stand out both for their attention to detail and meticulous presentation and for the fact that each dish tells a story, with nods to the chef's professional achievements, his native Linares (Ja\u00e9n), the island of Mallorca, the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 the list goes on.",

The chef takes a bold approach to almost everything, exploring new recipes and ingredients from elsewhere which he combines with superb local produce on his tasting menus.

He advocates a style of behaviour rather than a culinary doctrine: \"the whole philosophy behind my cooking, just as in art and in life, revolves around the pursuit of happiness\". This elegant restaurant, with its strikingly beautiful flooring, has a main dining area, a private dining room, and a glass-fronted terrace resembling a veranda \u2013 it all makes for a truly luxurious setting in the Salamanca district.

Out of his love and respect for Japanese culture, he aims to bring together Japanese and French elements; the white plates are like an artist\u2019s canvas and the colourful arrangements often include playful touches.",

The cuisine is redolent with the spirit of chakaiseki (tea ceremony cuisine), while always evolving; for example, in summer tomato surinagashi appears in cocktails.",

Two examples are the shredded carrots fried in a pot and arranged like fireworks, and the cylindrical sweet potatoes made to resemble those baked on hot pebbles. He has had great success going where none has gone before.",

The beauty of the setting will take your breath away, as will the views of Nerano bay from the terrace and the delicious cuisine showcasing the flavours and colours of Campania. Highly committed to his work front of house, much to the joy and delight of his guests, Antonio has handed over the reins in the kitchen to his son Fabrizio, who has succeeded in the difficult task of continuing to improve what already seemed perfect. The quintessentially Mediterranean cuisine showcases the purity of the extraordinary ingredients used, all of which are skilfully combined in dishes that appear simple but are in fact the result of highly sophisticated techniques, featuring superb natural flavours and harmonious combinations. The wine list is also excellent, with fine recommendations offered by the talented sommelier.",

His cuisine ranges from classic regional dishes interpreted in their purest form \u2013 such as his extraordinary agnolotti del plin \u2013 to more creative options, which demonstrate a connection with the region, whether in their ingredients or recipes. The setting here is that of an old monastery converted into a smart hotel, with meals served either in an elegant dining room or in the old limonaia (where lemon trees were once stored). The dishes on offer will linger long in the memory, from the generous amuses-bouches to the delicious bread and incredible focaccia, the top-quality meat and much more besides!",

Popular with food-lovers from Italy and abroad, Cervere is also a point of reference for many local businesses who supply the restaurant with capon, guinea fowl, veal, Carmagnola peppers, porcini mushrooms and much more besides. In summer, dine alfresco in the shade of a beautiful pergola among colourful flowers and a small fountain. Two small private rooms are available for intimate dinners, one of which is in the wine cellar surrounded by legendary bottles of wine.",

Looking across at Vesuvius, the word volcano comes to mind when describing chef Gennaro Esposito \u2013 he positively explodes with ideas, creating dishes and anticipating culinary trends as only a few chefs can, trends which are then picked up and copied by other restaurants. His Mediterranean cuisine makes much use of ingredients from Campania, some with combinations that sound strange on the menu but in the hands of Esposito reveal themselves to be full of harmonious contrasts. He uses the simplest fish and seafood (such as horse mackerel, grouper and albacore tuna) in his carefully prepared recipes which feature on tasting menus that showcase his culinary philosophy to the full. His raw fish dishes provide a feast for the eyes and the palate \u2013 the fish is sourced directly from local fishermen who bring the best of their catch here. The wine list includes renowned labels and fine vintages; a visit to the historic wine cellar in the tower basement is highly recommended.",

For many years, Di Costanzo has experimented with combinations that showcase every single ingredient in a dish, which are intended to be instantly recognisable however complex the recipe. Although there are no sea views here, it is fish (from around the island and neighbouring Procida) that takes pride of place on the menu in dishes that are memorable for their stunning presentation. Book the chef\u2019s table where you\u2019ll have the best view of the chef at work, although you can also catch glimpses of the activity in the kitchen from elsewhere in the dining room. The recently opened Salumeria bistro at the garden entrance serves traditional dishes from Campania in a small dining room, as well as outdoors on its shady terrace.

    "description": "Housed in the Savoy Beach Hotel, yet with its own entrance, Tre Olivi burst on to the culinary scene after being awarded two Michelin stars when previously it held none, so impressed were our inspectors by the skilful chef here. Today Giovanni Solofra works hard to consolidate his success, continuing to improve and always with a focus on the Cilento region. Originally from Torre Annunziata, not too far from here, this chef has fallen in love with the Cilento and its extraordinary ingredients, such as buffalo milk, Menaica anchovies and heritage flour varieties. Particular mention should be made of the various types of bread, including an outstanding brioche. Meals are served in an elegant, contemporary-style dining room adorned with decorations that pay tribute to olives.",

The dishes are well thought out, technically precise and replete with subtle contrasts. They also use home-grown ingredients. A four- to six-course set menu is served (vegetarian version also available). You also have the chef's classics on the \"Supplements\" menu to choose from. Stefano Petta's competent front-of-house team takes a pleasingly relaxed approach when it comes to serving guests. Tip: Reserve the Chef's Table! One floor below is the Widder Bar.",

His cuisine is complex but accessible \u2013 this is food that puts a smile on your face! From the excellent wine list, opt for the wines from the Zurich region, available by the glass.

Chef Heiko Nieder's elaborate and detail-oriented cooking is modern and creative but equally classical. This Schleswig-Holstein native always puts the (top-notch) produce centre stage and cooks up fantastically harmonious compositions. His vegetarian alternatives are no less impressive.

First-rate ingredients are used to create a very special set menu, each course of which is made up of several small dishes \u2013 all designed for sharing. Shored up by a competent sommelier, the charming service team is second to none. The outstanding wine list features top-notch wines, often regional, that are available by the glass.

The wine list verges on overwhelming with its choice of around 35\u00a0000 bottles, including first-rate labels in numerous vintages. The service is also excellent: courteous and professional from start to finish, but by no means stiff. The restaurant itself has a chic, upscale design and transparent, light-filled architecture; for the entirely glass-paned pavilion, the name \"Atelier\" (or workshop) is spot on. On account of its picture-postcard location on Lake Lucerne, complete with panoramic view, the terrace is naturally tempting! Tip: Verlinde Bar.",

This is a chef who cooks with respect for tradition and what nature has to offer. His predilection for sustainability is reflected, among other ways, in his no-waste approach and use of preservation techniques such as fermentation and dry-ageing. Traditional flavours take on an extra dimension.  Part of his originality lies in his nuanced use of delicate acidic and smoky flavours, with which he puts his own stamp on dishes. Take his preparation of manti, a delicate stuffed pasta; he fills them with rich lamb and serves them alongside a sublime smoked yoghurt cream, tomato tapenade and chilli butter. For dessert, he invites you into the open kitchen of this chic, contemporary establishment. Here you will find yourself in the thick of the action.",

Bibimbap composed with gochujang, crispy quinoa and tender Wagyu beef tartare will live long in the memory; while the branzino served simply with white kimchi shows that this is also a kitchen with the utmost confidence in the quality of its ingredients.This is cooking that is original, impeccably executed and enormously satisfying.

A sweet potato, slow-roasted until it achieves an almost custardy texture, is served with dashi broth and crispy fried yuba, while a perfectly crisp \"cutlet\" of panko-breaded mushroom, is paired with an ultra-rich sauce of foie gras and caramelized doenjang.

Danish chef\u00a0Ronny Emborg\u00a0and team serve up a menu of courses\u00a0that progress\u00a0from light and subtle to rich and robust.\u00a0Things are certainly grown-up\u00a0here, with such fully realized dishes as a rye cracker piped with ham and topped with crisped chicken skin; or a potato dumpling smartly dressed with parmesan foam. Paper-thin\u00a0Wagyu shavings\u00a0may then be enhanced with\u00a0a pour of hot dried shrimp\u00a0bouillon and confit quail egg yolk.There may be some\u00a0tweezer action as the chefs assemble their beguiling plates, but that also means there\u2019s nowhere to hide when food is this precise.",

A meal here begins with an assortment of antipasti, including smoked ricotta and carrot sformato, and it's clear from those first few bites that this will be an experience to treasure. Pastas are a highlight, with diners choosing from such delights as culurgiones, or Sardinian dumplings. It concludes as it began, with a smattering of bites, from lemon verbena meringue to a rich crostata Barozzi.-",

For example, when the vegetables, grown by the proprietress\u2019s family, are delivered to the kitchen, you may be startled to find that the first dish is deep-fried. He ends the meal with rice cooked in an earthenware pot, pork miso soup and dashimaki tamago, which he calls the Miyamoto family breakfast. Some of the bowls and plates are antiques and some created by modern artists.",

In summer a sumashijiru soup of ayu is served. Ayu bones are added to the dashi for extra flavour. Another unique approach that charms customers is how the ayu flesh in the soup is fragrantly char-grilled. The duck is smoked using grapevines, in a touch that reflects the cuisine of the Basque Country straddling Spain and France.",

Only here will you find shirako boldly skewered and grilled over binchotan, and only here will you eat melting slabs of chutoro buried under a blizzard of white truffles. Fish comes exclusively from Japan, and for the nigiri, assistants are quick to bring him his prized rice from Niigata prefecture,\u00a0warm and tinged with his special blend of vinegars, after every round. Laughter fills the air, thanks to Saito and his jovial team, and for a few blissful hours, the world outside melts away.",

    "description": "Smyth is so very chic, styled with a small lounge area resembling a living room, while a large portion of the floor plan is devoted to the impressive open kitchen.\u00a0This talented brigade, led by Chefs John Shields and Karen Urie Shields, has evolved since opening. Theirs is cooking that is desirable, impactful, and doesn't need an onslaught of luxury ingredients to impress.\u00a0Instead, sheer creativity is applied to seasonal produce. Wild Maine mussels are in a savory licorice cream; chilled avocado delights with\u00a0Bangkok guava paste and hoja santa. Then uni arrives glazed in egg yolk, while venison is spruced up with truffle liver ragout and sauce civet. For dessert, saffron ice cream drizzled with beeswax-thickened honey sits atop roasted quince.",

Discreetly perched atop the working brewery, this is a contemporary if at times austere dining room. Unsurprisingly, the word \"moody\" befits the intimate yet masculine vibe.Beverages are an equal partner to the food and even woven into the fabric of the elevated cuisine. Indulge in such innovative creations as gently poached Maine lobster in spiced tomato water, followed by seared Hudson Valley foie gras with burnt peach dashi.\u00a0A dark chocolate cake with toasted rye ice cream will lift your spirits and have you returning for more\u2014perhaps as soon as tomorrow.",
